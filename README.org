#+TITLE: Project README

This is a fun project for playing around with my strava data.

* Possible outputs
** Graphics
Chart maps and other fun graphs with various summary statistics (and routes)
** Maintenance 
Create an app that will keep track of wear and tear on components

* Maintenance App
The idea here is to create a lightweight way to track maintenance. I want to limit external dependencies and basically just get the minimum info from the activities and log it, with the ability then to see wear and tear by part, last time various maintenance tasks were performed, etc. 

** Things I need to figure out here:
- what's the best way to summarize the data?
- do i need to define all the parts of a bike somewhere? maybe there's a bike class? then when the db is loaded, it generates objects for existing bikes, riders, etc.?

* Installation/Usage Requirements
** stravalib
Just a good old =pip3.6 install --user stravalib=
