#+TITLE: Project README

This is a fun project for playing around with my strava data.

* Possible outputs
** Graphics
Chart maps and other fun graphs with various summary statistics (and routes)
** Maintenance 
Create an app that will keep track of wear and tear on components

* Installation/Usage Requirements
** swagger_client 
The app uses a package to connect to the strava api that hasn't been neatly bundled and is kind of a pain to install:
1. Make sure Java 7.1+ is installed
2. Make sure swagger and maven are installed
3. Generate the package using swagger
4. Install the package

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # java
  brew cask install caskroom/versions/java8

  # swagger and maven
  brew install swagger-codegen maven

  # create the package
  swagger-codegen generate -i https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json -l python -o python_strava_package

  # install the thing
  cd python_strava_package && python3 setup.py install
#+END_SRC
